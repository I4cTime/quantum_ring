# Troubleshooting

Start with the built-in self-check — it covers the most common failures in one shot:

```bash
qring doctor          # keyring backend, audit log, manifest, policy, qring-mcp on PATH
qring doctor --json   # same, machine-readable
```

Set `QRING_DEBUG=1` to get full stack traces from any CLI error instead of the one-line message.

## Keyring backend errors (most common first-run issue)

q-ring stores secrets in the OS keychain via [`@napi-rs/keyring`](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn/keyring-node): GNOME Keyring / Secret Service on Linux, Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows.

**Symptom:** `qring set` / `get` fails with a keyring error, or `qring doctor` reports the keyring probe failed.

- **Headless Linux / SSH / CI:** there is usually no unlocked Secret Service. Install and start one:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install gnome-keyring dbus-x11        # Debian/Ubuntu
  dbus-run-session -- sh -c 'echo "" | gnome-keyring-daemon --unlock; exec your-command'
  ```

  For CI pipelines, prefer `qring exec` / `qring ci:validate` on a runner with a keyring, or inject secrets through your CI's native secret store instead of q-ring.

- **Linux desktop:** make sure the login keyring is unlocked (it usually unlocks with your session). KDE users need `ksecretservice` or GNOME Keyring installed.
- **Docker:** containers have no OS keychain — the Docker image is for the MCP protocol surface and experiments, not durable storage (see the README's Docker section).

## MCP server not connecting (Cursor / Kiro / Claude Code)

1. `qring doctor` — confirms `qring-mcp` is on `PATH`. Editors spawn it by bare name; a shell alias is not enough.
2. Install globally so the binary lands on `PATH`: `pnpm add -g @i4ctime/q-ring` (or npm/yarn/brew).
3. GUI editors don't always inherit your shell's `PATH` (especially on macOS when launched from the Dock). If tools don't appear, set the absolute path in the MCP config:

   ```json
   { "mcpServers": { "q-ring": { "command": "/absolute/path/to/qring-mcp" } } }
   ```

   Find it with `command -v qring-mcp` (or `where qring-mcp` on Windows).
4. Approve the server when the editor prompts (Claude Code asks per-project for `.mcp.json` servers).
5. Still stuck? Run the handshake by hand — you should get a JSON `serverInfo` response:

   ```bash
   echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"0.0.0"}}}' | qring-mcp | head -1
   ```

## "Why can't the agent read my secret?" (approval gate)

Secrets stored with `--requires-approval` (or matching `policy.secrets.requireApprovalForTags`) refuse MCP reads until you grant a scoped, time-boxed approval:

```bash
qring approve MY_KEY --for 3600 --reason "deploying"
qring approvals        # see active grants, TTLs, and tamper status
```

The CLI itself is never gated — only MCP/agent reads are.

## "My policy is being ignored" (MCP policy root pinning)

Since 0.12.0 the MCP server resolves `.q-ring.json` **policy** from the directory it was launched in, not from the `projectPath` the agent passes (that closed a policy-escape hole). If your policy seems inactive over MCP:

- make sure the editor launches `qring-mcp` with the project as its working directory, or
- put the policy in the `.q-ring.json` at the server's launch directory.

Project-scoped *secret* resolution still follows `projectPath` — only policy is pinned.

## Audit log

- Default location: `~/.config/q-ring/audit.jsonl`. Override with `QRING_AUDIT_DIR` (created if missing) — useful for tests and sandboxes.
- `qring audit:verify` (or the dashboard's chain badge) checks the tamper-evident hash chain. A broken chain means the file was edited or partially deleted; export what you need (`qring audit:export`), then investigate before trusting the tail.

## Scripting gotchas

- Destructive commands (`delete`, `forget --all`, `teleport unpack` over existing keys, `wizard` over existing keys, `env:generate -o` over an existing file) prompt on a TTY and **error** on non-TTY stdin — pass `--yes`/`-y` in scripts.
- Machine output: `--json` works on effectively the whole read surface and emits `{ "ok": true, "data": … }` (see [cli-mcp-parity.md](cli-mcp-parity.md)).
- `qring get --raw` prints the bare value with no trailing newline — right for piping into other tools.
- `qring has KEY --quiet` is the exit-code-only existence check (decay-aware: expired secrets count as absent).

## AGPL questions

q-ring is AGPL-3.0-only. Using the CLI/MCP server as a tool in your workflow does **not** make your projects AGPL — the license applies to q-ring itself and derivative works of it. If you modify q-ring and offer it as a network service, you must publish your modifications. Not legal advice; see [LICENSE](../LICENSE).
