# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Status dashboard rebuilt** — `qring status` (and the `status_dashboard` MCP tool) now serves a denser, more useful live page. New surfaces:
  - **KPI strip** — total secrets, detected env, protected count, active approvals, hooks (enabled / total), 24-hour read & write counts, denied-action count, and live anomaly count.
  - **Manifest panel** — declared / required / missing / expired / stale keys from `.q-ring.json`.
  - **Policy panel** — at-a-glance MCP / exec / secret-policy presence with allow-deny / approval / rotation counts.
  - **Approvals panel** — every grant with scope, reason, time-remaining, and tamper / expiry state.
  - **Hooks panel** — every registered shell / HTTP / signal hook with its `key` / `tag` / `event` match summary.
  - **Agent memory panel** — count of encrypted memory keys.
  - **Sortable + searchable secrets table** — key / scope / env / type / decay / tags / last-read columns with quick chips (`expired`, `stale`, `protected`) and a `/`-focusable search box.
  - **Audit log filters** — action chips (`read` / `write` / `delete` / `export`), source chips (`cli` / `mcp` / `hook` / `agent`), and a free-text filter.
  - **Top-bar controls** — pause SSE updates, force refresh, jump to raw JSON, and a relative "updated Ns ago" timestamp that keeps ticking while paused.
  - **Keyboard shortcuts** — `/` focus secrets search, `P` pause, `R` refresh, `Esc` blur.
- **Snapshot payload expanded** — `/api/status` and the SSE stream now also include `version`, `projectPath`, `scopes`, `protectedCount`, `manifest`, `policy`, `approvals`, `hooks`, `memoryKeys`, and `auditMetrics` (action / source counts, top read keys, total events in the last 24h).

### Fixed
- **Dashboard search input no longer loses focus** — the SSE re-render now uses a focus-preserving DOM swap that retains caret position, selection, and scroll offset across the 5-second tick (previously, typing a search term would be wiped out on every snapshot).

## [0.10.1] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Publish workflow** — removed the `npm install -g npm@latest` bootstrap step that crashed with `Cannot find module 'promise-retry'` on the Node 22 runner image. The bundled npm from `setup-node@v4` is sufficient for `npm publish --provenance --access public`. This bug had silently blocked the v0.9.9 and v0.10.0 publish runs (both were tagged on GitHub but never reached npm).
- **Publish workflow** — added a `workflow_dispatch` trigger with an optional `ref` input so a stuck release can be re-published from the Actions tab without re-tagging.

### Notes
- Functional code is unchanged from v0.10.0; the bump exists solely to ship a new npm artifact through the now-fixed pipeline. v0.10.0's tag and GitHub Release stay in place for traceability.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-04-24

### Security
- **Approval HMAC widened** — `computeHmac` now covers `workspace` and `sessionId` in addition to id/key/scope/reason/grantedBy/grantedAt/expiresAt, so tampering with workspace- or session-bound approvals is detected and tokens are rejected as `tampered`.
- **Approval HMAC timing-safe compare** — verification uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` on fixed-length hex digests to reduce timing leakage.
- **Approval registry directory mode** — `~/.config/q-ring/` is created with explicit `mode: 0o700` for both the HMAC secret and the approvals registry.
- **JIT HTTP SSRF** — `checkJitHttpProvisionUrl` performs synchronous `dns.lookupSync` for non–IP-literal hostnames, blocks non-`http(s)` URLs, and **fails closed** on DNS errors (closes the “sync check passes hostname, child resolves to private” gap).
- **Teleport AES-GCM** — new bundles use a **12-byte** IV (recommended nonce length); unpacking unchanged for existing bundles.
- **Registry file permissions** — `entanglement.json` and `hooks.json` writes use mode `0o600`.
- **Shell hooks** — `exec` replaced with `execFile` (`/bin/sh -c` / Windows `cmd /d /s /c`) with bounded stdout buffer; signal hooks require a strict numeric PID or a constrained `pgrep -f` pattern (no spaces / metacharacters).

### Added
- **CLI decomposed by category** — replaced the monolithic `register-cli-part{1,2,3}.ts` files with nine themed modules under `src/cli/commands/` (`secrets`, `project`, `quantum`, `validation`, `tooling`, `audit`, `hooks`, `agent`, `security`) plus shared `helpers.ts` / `options.ts`.
- **MCP tools decomposed by category** — split the 1.5k-line `tool-registration.ts` into ten focused modules under `src/mcp/tools/` (`secrets`, `project`, `tunnel`, `teleport`, `validation`, `tooling`, `audit`, `hooks`, `agent`, `policy`) with a shared `_shared.ts` for Zod schemas and policy enforcement helpers.
- **Grouped CLI help** — custom `GroupedHelp` renderer displays commands under nine themed sections (Secrets, Project, Quantum, Validation & Rotation, Dev Tooling, Audit & Health, Hooks, Agent Memory, Security & Governance) with glyph headers and dimmed ungrouped fallback.
- `src/version.ts` — single `PACKAGE_VERSION` from `package.json` for CLI + MCP.
- `src/services/list-secrets-filter.ts` — shared glob/tag filtering used by CLI and MCP.
- Global `--json` flag + `qring get --raw`; bracketed MCP tool tags; JSON payloads for several tools; `get_policy_summary` policy-gated.
- `docs/cli-mcp-parity.md` — full CLI ↔ MCP command/tool mapping, with notes on shared behavior, intentional differences, and remaining CLI-only / MCP-only functionality.
- Cursor plugin: `/qring:dashboard`, `/qring:analyze`, `/qring:exec-safe`; `exec-with-secrets` skill; hook tweaks; `pnpm run plugin:sync` + `docs:publish-log` scripts.
- ESLint + Prettier (`pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run format`); CI runs lint on `main`/`develop` pushes.
- New tests: `keyring-lifecycle.test.ts`, `ssrf-jit.test.ts`, and an approval-tamper test that asserts the widened HMAC rejects forged `workspace` / `sessionId` fields (164 total tests across 24 files).

### Changed
- `get` CLI default output is JSON; use `--raw` for legacy stdout-only value.
- MCP: `get_secret`, `list_secrets`, `tunnel_*` create/read, `generate_secret` (unsaved), `agent_recall` return structured JSON text.
- `teleport_unpack` errors expose machine-readable `ERR_TELEPORT_*` messages (MCP returns JSON error object).
- Renamed `httpRequest_` → `httpRequest` across `src/utils/http-request.ts` and call sites (`core/hooks.ts`, `core/validate.ts`); the underlying `node:http` request is now imported as `httpRequestPlain` to avoid the shadowing that drove the old underscore suffix.

### Fixed
- `policy.secrets` is now enforced on `setSecret` via `checkSecretLifecyclePolicy`.
- JIT envelope refresh uses cross-process file lock under `~/.config/q-ring/jit-locks/`.
- `queryAudit` reads at most the last 12MB of `audit.jsonl` to cap memory.
- `matchGlob` ignores overlong branch patterns.
- `parseEnvelope` / teleport bundles validated with Zod; `checkDecay` handles invalid dates.
- JIT HTTP / AWS configs validated with Zod in `provision.ts`.
- Shared secret detection for `scan` + `lint` via `secrets-detect.ts`.
- Removed dead `src/services/types.ts` (`ServiceResult`/`okResult`/`errResult` were never imported) and the `void listSecrets;` tree-shake workaround in the MCP project tools.
- Silenced unused-parameter warnings in `src/core/exec.ts` (`_encoding`) and `src/core/keyring.ts` (`_match`) so `--noUnusedParameters` stays clean.

## [0.9.9] — 2026-03-25

### Security
- **hono >=4.12.12** — pnpm override resolving 5 medium vulnerabilities (cookie name bypass, setCookie validation, IPv4-mapped IPv6 in ipRestriction, serveStatic traversal, toSSG path traversal) in transitive dependency via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **@hono/node-server >=1.19.13** — pnpm override resolving serveStatic bypass in transitive dependency via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- **vite >=8.0.5** — pnpm override resolving 3 vulnerabilities (2 high: fs.deny bypass + WebSocket file read; 1 medium: optimized deps .map traversal) in dev dependency via `vitest`.

## [0.9.8] — 2026-03-25

### Security
- **SSRF protection expanded** — extracted `checkSSRF` into shared `src/core/ssrf.ts` module; applied async guard to `validate.ts` (httpProvider) and sync guard to `provision.ts` (JIT HTTP provider). Blocks requests to private/loopback/link-local addresses.
- **Shell injection fix** — replaced `exec("pgrep -f ...")` with `spawn("pgrep", ["-f", target])` in `hooks.ts` to prevent shell metacharacter injection in signal hook targets.
- **Dashboard XSS fix** — `renderAudit` now escapes `e.action` through `esc()` in both class attributes and text content, preventing script injection via audit log entries.
- **MCP policy enforcement** — `listSecrets`, `exportSecrets`, `hasSecret`, `deleteSecret`, and `getEnvelope` now enforce `checkKeyReadPolicy` when `source === "mcp"`, closing a policy bypass for all read/write operations.
- **Tunnel ID crypto hardening** — replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomBytes()` for tunnel ID generation, ensuring CSPRNG-quality identifiers.
- **Memory key hardening** — AES-256-GCM encryption key now stored in OS keyring (`@napi-rs/keyring`) instead of derived from `SHA-256(hostname+username)`. Includes automatic migration from legacy key derivation and fallback for environments without keyring access.
- **Glob-to-regex escaping** — regex metacharacters (`.+?^${}()|[]\\`) are now escaped before `*` → `.*` conversion in both `mcp/server.ts` (list_secrets filter) and `hooks.ts` (keyPattern matching), preventing ReDoS and unintended matches.
- **Exec profile hardening** — `denyCommands` matching upgraded from substring (`includes`) to word-boundary regex, preventing false positives and evasion via embedded substrings.
- **Dependency overrides** — added `path-to-regexp >=8.4.0` (root) pnpm override to resolve known vulnerability. `brace-expansion` in web is an upstream ESLint transitive dependency (minimatch@3 → brace-expansion@1) and cannot be overridden without breaking the API.
- **CSP meta tag** — added `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag to `web/app/layout.tsx` for defense-in-depth on GitHub Pages (where HTTP headers aren't configurable).

### Added
- **`src/core/ssrf.ts`** — new shared module exporting `isPrivateIP`, `checkSSRF` (async with DNS resolution), and `checkSSRFSync` (sync, IP-literal only).
- **SSRF test suite** — 12 tests covering private IP detection, async/sync SSRF guards, IPv4/IPv6/mapped addresses, and environment variable override.
- **Tunnel ID uniqueness test** — verifies 100 generated IDs are unique and match base64url suffix pattern.

## [0.9.7] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Nav anchor links on subpages** — clicking Features, Quick Start, Plugin, Dashboard, MCP, or Architecture from `/docs` or `/changelog` now routes back to the homepage before scrolling to the target section. Replaced plain `<a>` tags with Next.js `<Link>` for proper client-side navigation.

## [0.9.6] — 2026-03-26

### Security
- **Double-escaping fix** — `parseDotenv()` escape-sequence chain replaced with single-pass regex to prevent double-unescape of backslash sequences (CodeQL `js/double-escaping` alert #14, severity: high).
- **picomatch >=4.0.4 (web)** — pnpm override added to `web/package.json` resolving ReDoS (GHSA-c2c7-rcm5-vvqj) and method injection (GHSA-3v7f-55p6-f55p) in web lockfile.
- **Stale `package-lock.json` removed** — eliminated false-positive Dependabot alerts from an unused npm lockfile; added to `.gitignore`.

### Added
- **`parseDotenv` test suite** — 8 unit tests covering escape sequences, double-backslash handling, quoted values, inline comments, and edge cases (133 total tests).

## [0.9.5] — 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Cursor marketplace plugin** — `cursor-plugin/` with 3 rules, 4 skills, 2 agents, 5 commands, 2 hooks, MCP connector, and marketplace manifest. Surfaces all 44 MCP tools through IDE-native components.
- **Marketplace discovery** — `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` at repo root for monorepo-based plugin resolution.
- **Web: Cursor Plugin section** — homepage component with animated cards for all plugin components.
- **Web: Plugin nav link** — "Plugin" added to site navigation.
- **Web: Homebrew install tabs** — Homebrew option added to Hero and docs install commands.
- **README: Cursor Plugin section** — table summarizing all plugin components with marketplace install instructions.
- **README: Homebrew install** — `brew install i4ctime/tap/qring` added to Installation section.

### Changed
- **Web: docs page** — Step 4 added for Cursor Plugin with component grid and manual install terminal.
- **Web: Footer** — version updated from v0.9.1 to v0.9.4.

### Fixed
- **beforeShellExecution hook removed** — Cursor injects base64 metadata into hook commands, causing a circular block. Shell command warnings moved to the `secret-hygiene` rule instead.

### Security
- **picomatch >=4.0.4** — pnpm override added to resolve ReDoS vulnerability (GHSA-c2c7-rcm5-vvqj) and method injection (GHSA-3v7f-55p6-f55p) in `tsup > tinyglobby > picomatch`.

## [0.9.4] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Vitest test suite** — 125 tests across 17 files covering core modules (noise, envelope, tunnel, teleport, entanglement, scan, linter, memory, hooks, approval, observer, policy, collapse, scope), CLI command registration, and MCP tool registration (all 44 tools verified).
- **CI test step** — `pnpm run test:ci` added to `ci.yml` workflow after the build step.
- **Homebrew tap** — `I4cTime/homebrew-tap` repo with `Formula/qring.rb` for `brew tap I4cTime/tap && brew install qring`.
- **Homebrew auto-update workflow** — `update-homebrew.yml` triggers on release, waits for npm availability, computes sha256, and pushes the updated formula automatically.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-03-25

### Changed
- **Custom domain** — site now served at `qring.i4c.studio` instead of `i4ctime.github.io/quantum_ring`. Removed `basePath`, updated all asset paths and metadata.
- **Funding** — Ko-fi slug updated to `i4ctime`.
- **Favicon** — icon metadata added to layout for branded browser/Apple touch icons.
- **Deploy workflow** — CNAME file persists across `gh-pages` deploys.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **README** — improved intro with structured feature list, added documentation link callout, replaced broken Glama badge with card layout, added License and MCP Tools badges, corrected MCP tool count from 31 to 44.
- **Docs page** — added short descriptions to every CLI command in the web reference.
- **Repo settings** — added CODEOWNERS, updated branch rulesets to require `check` + `analyze` status checks and code owner review, disabled default CodeQL setup.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **CHANGELOG** — added missing Tier 4–6 feature entries (composite secrets, approvals, JIT, exec, scanner, linter, memory, context, governance, scopes, rotation, CI validation, audit export) to the v0.9.0 record.
- **Web landing site** — added 11 feature cards, 3 MCP tool groups (15 tools), 8 architecture modules; updated tool count from 31 to 44 and feature count from 13 to 24.
- **Web changelog** — synced with CHANGELOG.md.
- **Stats** — removed Tiers and Platforms cards; kept MCP Tools and Quantum Features.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Composite / Templated Secrets** — store connection strings with `{{OTHER_KEY}}` placeholders that resolve dynamically on read. MCP tool: `get_secret` (template resolution is automatic).
- **User Approvals (Zero-Trust Agent)** — mark secrets with `--requires-approval` so MCP reads require HMAC-verified, scoped, time-limited approval tokens. CLI: `qring approve`, `qring approvals`. MCP: approval enforcement on `get_secret`.
- **JIT Provisioning** — dynamically generate short-lived tokens on read (AWS STS, Generic HTTP). CLI: `qring set --jit-provider aws-sts`. MCP: automatic JIT resolution on `get_secret`.
- **Secure Execution & Auto-Redaction** — `qring exec` injects secrets into command environments with automatic stdout/stderr redaction of known values. Exec profiles restrict allowed commands.
- **Exec Profiles** — `unrestricted`, `restricted` (blocks curl/wget/ssh, 30s timeout), and `ci` (5min timeout) profiles for `qring exec --profile`. MCP tool: `exec_with_secrets`.
- **Codebase Secret Scanner** — `qring scan` detects hardcoded credentials using regex heuristics and Shannon entropy analysis. MCP tool: `scan_codebase_for_secrets`.
- **Secret-Aware Linter** — `qring lint` scans specific files for hardcoded secrets with optional `--fix` to auto-replace with `process.env.KEY` references. MCP tool: `lint_files`.
- **Agent Memory** — encrypted, persistent key-value store for AI agent sessions. CLI: `qring remember`, `qring recall`, `qring forget`. MCP tools: `agent_remember`, `agent_recall`, `agent_forget`.
- **Project Context** — safe, redacted overview of project secrets, configuration, and state for agent system prompts. CLI: `qring context`. MCP tool: `get_project_context`.
- **Pre-Commit Secret Scanning** — `qring hook:install` adds a git pre-commit hook that blocks commits containing hardcoded secrets.
- **Secret Analytics** — `qring analyze` reports most accessed, unused, stale secrets and gives rotation recommendations. MCP tool: `analyze_secrets`.
- **Service Setup Wizard** — `qring wizard` scaffolds a new service integration with secrets, manifest entries, and hooks in one command.
- **Governance Policy** — `.q-ring.json` `policy` section for MCP tool gating, key access restrictions, exec allowlists, and secret lifecycle rules. CLI: `qring policy`. MCP tools: `check_policy`, `get_policy_summary`.
- **Team & Org Scopes** — `--team` and `--org` flags extend resolution beyond `global` and `project`. Cascade order: project → team → org → global.
- **Issuer-Native Rotation** — `qring rotate` attempts provider-native rotation (OpenAI, Stripe, etc.) or falls back to local generation. MCP tool: `rotate_secret`.
- **CI Secret Validation** — `qring ci:validate` batch-validates all secrets against providers in CI-friendly mode with structured pass/fail output. MCP tool: `ci_validate_secrets`.
- **Tamper-Evident Audit Verify & Export** — `qring audit:verify` checks SHA-256 hash chain integrity; `qring audit:export` outputs jsonl/json/csv. MCP tools: `verify_audit_chain`, `export_audit`.
- **Shared HTTP client** (`http-request`) for validation and hooks with timeouts and response size limits.
- **HTTP hook SSRF mitigation** — resolves hook URLs and blocks private/loopback targets by default; override with `Q_RING_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOOKS=1` if needed. Denied attempts emit `policy_deny` audit events.
- **Next.js GitHub Pages site** (`web/`) — Tailwind CSS v4, Motion animations, Getting Started (`/docs`) and Changelog (`/changelog`) pages, mobile nav, copyable terminals, animated stats, interactive architecture diagram. Deploy via `deploy-pages.yml` and CI via `nextjs.yml`.

### Changed
- MCP server tool count increased from 31 to 44.
- Architecture expanded with Exec, Scan, Provision, Approval, Context, Linter, Memory, and Policy subsystems.
- **Dashboard** — pathname routing fixes, SSE backpressure, tighter CORS, inline/system fonts and assets for offline use.
- **README** — notes on SSRF protection for HTTP hooks.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Secret Liveness Validation** — `qring validate` tests if a secret is actually valid with its target service. Built-in providers for OpenAI, Stripe, GitHub, AWS, and Generic HTTP with auto-detection from key prefixes. MCP tools: `validate_secret`, `list_providers`.
- **Hooks on Secret Change** — register shell commands, HTTP webhooks, or process signals that fire when secrets are written, deleted, or rotated. CLI: `qring hook add/list/remove/enable/disable/test`. MCP tools: `register_hook`, `list_hooks`, `remove_hook`.
- **`.env` file import** — `qring import .env` parses dotenv syntax and bulk-stores secrets. MCP tool: `import_dotenv`.
- **Project Secret Manifest** — declare required secrets in `.q-ring.json` and validate with `qring check`. MCP tool: `check_project`.
- **Env File Sync** — `qring env:generate` produces a `.env` from the project manifest. MCP tool: `env_generate`.
- **Disentangle command** — `qring disentangle` exposes the existing core function to CLI and MCP.
- **Selective Export** — `qring export --keys` and `--tags` filter which secrets are exported. Same filters on MCP `export_secrets`.
- **branchMap glob support** — `.q-ring.json` branchMap now supports `*` wildcards (e.g. `release/*`).
- **Configurable rotation** — `--rotation-format` and `--rotation-prefix` on `qring set` control auto-rotation shape.
- **Secret search/filtering** — `qring list --tag`, `--expired`, `--stale`, `--filter` flags.
- **Provider metadata** — `provider` field on `SecretMetadata` and `ManifestEntry` for validation auto-detection.

### Changed
- MCP server tool count increased from 20 to 31.
- Architecture expanded with Validate, Hooks, and Import subsystems.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-03-21

### Security
- Resolved 8 CodeQL `js/clear-text-logging` alerts by sanitizing keyring metadata before CLI output.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Dashboard re-rendering** — Cards are now created once and updated in-place via differential DOM patching. No more flickering or re-animation on every SSE tick.
- **Audit log noise** — `qring list` calls from the dashboard no longer generate audit entries (silent mode) and `list` events are filtered from the dashboard feed.

### Changed
- **Increased dashboard font sizes** — Base font bumped from 14px to 16px; all panel text sizes proportionally increased for readability.
- **Header icon** — Replaced inline SVG with the project icon from gh-pages (`icon.png`).
- **README** — Added Quantum Status Dashboard section with CLI usage and flags; added Dashboard to architecture diagram.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Quantum Status Dashboard** — `qring status` launches a local browser dashboard with live SSE updates showing health summary, decay timers, superposition states, entanglement graph, active tunnels, audit log, anomaly alerts, and environment detection.
- **MCP `status_dashboard` tool** — AI agents can start the dashboard server and return the URL.
- **MCP Registry support** — `server.json` and `mcpName` field for publishing to `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`.
- **GitHub issue templates** — bug report and feature request forms.
- **SECURITY.md** — vulnerability disclosure policy.

### Changed
- Fixed shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) now present on both `dist/index.js` and `dist/mcp.js`.
- Corrected `bin` paths in `package.json` per npm standards.

## [0.2.9] — 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Added `mcpName` field to `package.json` for MCP Registry compatibility.
- Fixed `tsup.config.ts` to add shebang to `dist/mcp.js`.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-03-20

### Added
- Initial public release with quantum keyring core, MCP server (20 tools), and CLI.
- Superposition, entanglement, tunneling, teleportation, decay, observer, and agent features.
- GitHub Pages landing site.
- Glama integration with `glama.json` and Dockerfile.
